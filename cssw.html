<h2><u>Electromagnetic Radiation</u></h2>
         The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of frequencies (the spectrum) of electromagnetic radiation and their respective wavelengths and photon energies. 
         <br><br>
		The electromagnetic spectrum covers electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging from below one hertz to above 1025 hertz, corresponding to wavelengths from thousands of kilometres down to a fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus. This frequency range is divided into separate bands, and the electromagnetic waves within each frequency band are called by different names; beginning at the low frequency (long wavelength) end of the spectrum these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays at the high-frequency (short wavelength) end.
<br><br>

<h3>1. Radio waves</h3> - Radio waves are the lowest-frequency waves in the EM spectrum and are utilized for data transmission from transmitters, satellites, as well as radars.</li>
<h3>2.Microwaves</h3> - Microwaves are the second-lowest frequency waves in the EM spectrum. These waves have been utilized for data transmissions, heating foodstuff, etc.
<h3>3.UV (Ultraviolet) waves</h3> - Solar energy generates ultraviolet radiation. These waves have even shorter wavelengths than visible light. Exposure to this radiation leads to sunburns and can cause cancer in living organisms.
<h3>4.X-rays</h3> - These are extremely high-energy waves with wavelengths ranging from 0.03 nm to 3 nm, However, they are not much longer than an atom. X-rays are emitted by sources producing very high temperatures like the sun's corona, which is much hotter than the surface of the sun. These waves were also utilized in imaging technology to obtain images of the bone structures inside the body of an organism.
<h3>5.Gamma rays</h3> - These waves are the highest-frequency EM waves, and are emitted by only the most energetic cosmic objects such as pulsars, neutron stars, supernovas, and black holes.
<h3>6.Infrared</h3> - Infrared waves are in the lower-middle range of frequencies in the EM spectrum, between microwaves and visible light. Its size ranges from a few millimetres down to microscopic lengths.
<h3>7.Visible light</h3> - The most noticeable natural source of visible light is the sun. The different colours of the objects are perceived based on the wavelengths of light an object absorbs and reflects. The visible band falls in the range of wavelengths of from 390 nm to 700 nm.

<br> Blue, green, and red are the primary colours or wavelengths of the visible spectrum. They are defined as such because no single primary colour can be created from the other two, but all other colours can be formed by combining blue, green, and red in various proportions.
<h3>Remote Sensing</h3>
       Remote sensing is the technology of acquiring information about the Earth's surface without actually being contact with it. This is done by sensing and recording reflected or emitted energy and processing, analysing and applying that information. It is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance.
<br>
<h3>Components of Remote Sensing</h3>
<ul type="alpbabet">
<li>(A)	Energy source or illumination </li>
<li>(B)	Radiation and the atmosphere</li>
<li>(C)	Interaction with the target </li>
<li>(D)	Recording of energy by the sensor</li>
<li>(E)	Transmission, reception and processing </li>
<li>(F)	Interpretation and analysis </li>
<li>(G)	Application</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>(A)-Energy source or illumination</u></h4> 
The first requirement for remote sensing is to have an energy source which illuminates or provides electromagnetic energy to the target of interest. 
<h4><u>(B)-Radiation and the atmosphere</u></h4> 
As the 19 energy travels from its Source to the target, it will come in contact with and interact with the atmosphere it passes through. This interaction may take place a second time as the energy travels from the target to the sensor.
<h4><u>(C)-Interaction with the target</u></h4>
Once the energy makes its way to the target through the atmosphere, it interacts with the target depending on the properties of both the target and radiation.
<h4><u>(D)- Recording of energy by the sensor</u></h4> 
After the energy has been scattered by or emitted from the target, we require a sensor (remote-not in contact with the target) to Collected record the electromagnetic radiation.
<h4><u>(E)- Recording of energy by the sensor</u></h4> 
The energy recorded by the sensor has to be transmitted, often in electronic form to a receiving and processing station where the data are processed into an image (hardcopy or digital).
<h4><u>(F)- Interpretation and analysis</u></h4> 
The processed image is interpreted visually or digitally to extract information about the target which was illuminated.
<h4><u>(G)- Application</u></h4> 
Once the information is obtained from imagery about the target, we apply it to reveal more information or assist in solving a particular problem.
<h3><u>Classification of Remote Sensing:</u></h3>
With respect to the type of energy resources, remote sensing is classified into two categories – passive and active remote sensing.
<h4>i. Passive Remote Sensing:</h4>
It makes use of sensors that detect the reflected or emitted electro-magnetic radiation from natural sources.
<h4>ii. Active Remote Sensing:</h4>
It makes use of sensors that detect reflected responses from objects that are irradiated from artificially-generated energy sources, such as radar.


<h3><u><center>CONCLUSION</center></u></h3>
The application of GIS has increased over the years. The reason is the advancement in technology which have allowed people to do more with the tool.
The different uses of GIS are evident by looking at its applications different industries. Along with this, it also has academic uses such as teaching students about geography and exploring their geographical surroundings.
